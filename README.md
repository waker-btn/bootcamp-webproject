# TechNative Bootcamp Blog

This repository contains a personal blog documenting my journey through the TechNative Digital Software Development Bootcamp. Each week, I post a summary of what I learned, the exercises I completed, and my reflections. Future weeks will be added progressively, incorporating CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies as I learn them.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Homepage with links to each week’s post.
- `week1.html` – My first week at the bootcamp (HTML only).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is twofold:
1. **Documentation:** Keep track of my learning process and progress throughout the bootcamp.
2. **Experimentation:** Apply new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills weekly to improve the website itself.

            Week two of the TechNative Digital Software Development Bootcamp was
            all about CSS - taking everything we built last week with HTML and
            learning how to make it look good. After spending week one focused
            on structure and semantics, this was where things started to come to
            life visually.

            <h2 class="blog__content__title">Building the Basics</h2>
            <p>
              We started the week with a tutorial that walked us through the
              fundamentals of CSS - selectors, properties, the box model,
              colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. It was a great refresher and
              helped fill in a few gaps I didn't even realise I had. Once we got
              the basics down, it was time to put it into practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              I paired up with Louise again, and together we revisited the
              website we built in week one. This time, our job was to style it
              from scratch. It was a great way to reinforce what we'd just
              learned, especially things like how to target specific elements
              efficiently and how different display types behave. By the end, it
              was satisfying to see our previously bare HTML start to feel like
              a real website.

            <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              The next day was a full-on challenge. I worked with Yash, and our
              task was to recreate a site design using only HTML and CSS. This
              was where flexbox really came into play - we used it heavily for
              layout, and it finally clicked just how powerful it is for
              positioning and aligning content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between flex properties, spacing tweaks, and consistent styling,
              the site slowly came together. It went really smoothly overall - I
              felt confident throughout the day, like I actually understood what
              was happening and why things behaved the way they did. We covered
              so much: typography, color palettes, borders, responsive elements,
              and more. It's amazing how much of a difference a few well-chosen
              CSS rules can make.

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            Week two was a big confidence booster. It's one thing to know what
            CSS does in theory, but it's another to see how all the pieces fit
            together to create a cohesive design.

            Next week we'll be diving into <q>JavaScript</q> - which means
            interactivity, logic, and the start of making our sites do things
            rather than just look good. I'm excited and ready to keep building
            on what we've learned so far.

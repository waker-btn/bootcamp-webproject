          My First Week at the TechNative Digital Software Development Bootcamp
        </h1>

        <p>
          <time datetime="2025-09-15">Last week</time> was a big step for me - I
          officially started the TechNative Digital Software Development
          Bootcamp! I'm changing careers, moving away from the post-production
          industry and into software development. It's something I've always had
          in the back of my mind since studying Computer Science at university,
          and now feels like the right time to give it a proper go. I've missed
          that feeling of learning something new and stretching my brain, so I'm
          excited to dive in!

          <h2>Day One: Induction & Collaboration</h2>
          <p>
            The first day was an induction day, so a lot of it was about meeting
            people and setting the scene. There were learners from all different
            bootcamps, and it was great to see such a wide range of people all
            chasing new skills and new careers. We had a talk about TechNative
            Digital's mission. For my course specifically, they want to bridge
            that tricky gap between self-learning and being ready for a real job
            in tech. It really resonated with me, because I've done bits of
            self-learning before but always felt there was a missing step to
            make it “professional.” Afterwards, we broke off into our own
            bootcamp groups and talked about how the course would be structured
            - starting every day with a stand-up and ending with a
            retrospective. I liked that idea; it feels like a proper team
            environment rather than just a classroom.

            In the afternoon, we jumped into our first group task. My little
            team invented “Pet-working” - a site for pet owners to share advice,
            connect with others, and make sure everyone knows how to look after
            their animals properly. We had to think about what the product was,
            how the website would work, and even how it might make money. Then
            we presented it back to the group, which was equal parts fun and
            nerve-wracking.
          </p>
          <p>
            We wrapped up the day by creating our Pirate Code - basically a set
            of rules we all agreed to follow throughout the course. Things like
            <q>there are no stupid questions</q>, <q>be kind</q>, and
            <q>share resources</q>.<br />
            It felt like a nice way to set the tone: supportive, open, and
            collaborative.

          <h2>Day Two: Strengthening HTML Foundations</h2>
          <p>
            Day two was when things got properly hands-on. The focus was HTML,
            which I thought I already had a decent handle on - but this reminded
            me there's always more to learn. We started off with some pair
            exercises. First up, we were given a recipe written out in plain
            text, and our job was to structure it properly as a web page. Then
            we did the same with a dictionary definition. Simple on the surface,
            but a great way to practice things like headings, ordered vs
            unordered lists, and making sure we were using tags that actually
            made sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came the bigger challenge. We were given three styled web pages
            and asked to build the HTML structure for each - no CSS allowed. At
            first, I panicked and thought we had to recreate the styling with
            just HTML (visions of endless <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tags
            flashed before my eyes). But thankfully, it was all about structure,
            not presentation. That's where semantic tags really clicked for me.
            I had never really given them much thought, but we learnt that using
            them had many benefits.

            For accessibility reasons, like screen readers, and also for our
            future learning, where we will begin reusing things more and more.
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and
            <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> were suddenly very useful, whereas before
            I hadn't even heard of them. By the end of the day, I'd surprised
            myself. I thought I knew HTML, but turns out there's always another
            layer of understanding waiting to be unlocked.

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            So that was week one: a mix of meeting new people, building team
            spirit, and levelling up my coding basics. It's only been two days,
            but I already feel like I've learned loads. Next week is all about
            CSS, which I'm really looking forward to. I've used it before, but
            I'm hoping to really cement my knowledge and, like with HTML,
            discover things I didn't know I didn't know. It's early days, but if
            the first week is anything to go by, this is going to be a
            challenging, inspiring, and genuinely fun journey.
